## Overview
Project Name is Match Outcome Predictor. This project aims to predict the outcome of English football premier league matches based on certain features that will be entered by the user.
It is designed to tell us whether the Home or Away team is likely to win or the game ends as a draw. It functions by calculating rolling averages such as the difference in form points, 
which represents the points gained across the last 5 games for that team(either home or away). we made use of a premier league dataset found at:
